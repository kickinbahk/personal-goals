## Are you a Hacker?

Hacker is a strange word in the software community these days. It seems it must always be accompanied by a clarification. This is how Steven Levy defines several generations of men and women involved in the creation of computing. To understand what he means by this term, we must explore what some of these men and women were doing at the time. Let's set the stage...  

Imagine a time where what you were doing on a computer was the first time it ever had been done, in the **history** of computers. The language you write is the first real computer language. They game you create is the first computer game *EVER*. Your program to play music through the computer's speakers is the *FIRST* time anyone has made music with a machine in this way.

**The first...EVER** 

This is a time where computers still took up small rooms and the time spent on them was limited because so many people wanted to have access to them. To get around this, the hackers of the time would change their sleeping patterns to be able to access the computer in off hours, 12am-5am. 

This was the time of the TX-0 and later the PDP 1. This was the dawn of the time you could TELL a computer to do something. You would be able to think of something you wanted the computer to do, that it could not already, and write a program to do it.

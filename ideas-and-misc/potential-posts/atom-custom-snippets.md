## Making Custom Snippets in Atom

I have been using atom for about a month now. It has quickly become my editor of choice after using Emacs for most of my coding career. Coming from an editor like Emacs, I am used to having the option to customize almost anything I would like to and as I have used Atom, I have looked to make some of the customizations that I like to use.

One of these customizations are 'Snippets'. They are basically autocomplete for code, similar to how [TextExpander](http://textexpander.com) works. Not only were there a couple custom snippets I wanted to add, but I also wanted to change some of the default options since I used Standard and end up having to remove a lot of semi-colons from the default Javascript snippets.

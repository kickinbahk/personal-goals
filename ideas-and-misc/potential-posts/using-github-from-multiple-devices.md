## Using Github From Multiple Devices

I dropped Evernote as my note and writing tool and I am now using Github for any writing and note-taking needs. This is made possible by being able to edit the notes on multiple devices. This is done by editing the markdown or text files from the github website.

### Editing with a Computer

As a developer, I am used to working with github. You will need to set up a [github account](), installed Git, and initialized git in a folder on your device or clone the repo to your computer. [This article by Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/5983680/how-the-heck-do-i-use-github) describes the process of doing this.

As you might expect, I am just making changes to a file with my text editor (Emacs), then staging, committing them, and pushing it to Github. 

### Editing from Github Website

Editing from the website is as simple as navigating to the file you want to work on, then clicking the "pencil" in the top right hand side. When you are done, you can commit the changes right from the bottom of this page.

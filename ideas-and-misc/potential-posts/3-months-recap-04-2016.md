# 3 Months in Review - 04/2016

I have talked about my habit of reviewing and recapping every 3 months or so. As I have been blogging about it, I decided to do my recap as a blog post. An added benefit is that blogging about it should provide some additional organization and coherancy as writing tends to do. 


## Recapping the 1st Quarter

### Learning Node 
I have really enjoyed getting to know Node and building apps with it. The community around it has been great and the package management with npm also provides a lot with the libraries built with the language. 

### Javascript Deep Dive
I begun focusing on vanilla javascript. I wanted to make sure I have a clearer understanding of how javascript is working under the hood. This also included getting up-to-date with the new features added by Ecmascript 2015 spec which I did with the presentation last month. 

### React
I have started learning React and the components of the framework and did a simple blog with React and Flux.

### Personal Goals 
I heard [Una Kravets](http://unakravets.com/) talk about having her learning goals on Github and it made a lot of sense to me. I have opensourced my personal goals. Primarily for accessibility for multiple devices, transparency, and some accountiblity.

## Looking Ahead 

### Mostly Node Podcast
A converstational style podcast between myself and another developer learning Node. Expected release for first episode is early April.

### Using Sublime
After seeing some of the inline linting available in Sublime, I decided to try using it for a time instead of Emacs. I will re-evaluate it in the next recap.

### Continued Learning of Node
I am going to start building a chat app using Node and Socket.io. I plan on continuing to work with Node for the next 3 months. 

### Continued Learning of React
I plan on using it for more front end work in the future.

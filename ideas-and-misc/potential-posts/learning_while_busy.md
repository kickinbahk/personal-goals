## Learning while Busy

Sometimes life can catch you off guard and you are just trying to hang on for dear life. Other times, you can see the ramp up coming and prepare for the onslaught.

When things get busy, I still feel that it is important for me to not lose my momentum in the learning I am currently doing. I experienced this first hand recently as I got married. A wedding is a big deal and can be very time consuming...there is a constant amount of things to accomplish and tasks to get done. I found that there was always more to do and other things to think about.

I have set up a couple strategies for myself so that when these busy times come along, I am still able to continue learning. I generally rely on 3 different things track my learning and these habits continue when I am busy.

1) Accountibility with my ToDos
2) Accountibility with Another Person
3) Guided Learning

## Oh Node You Didn't

We use the term 'indecisive' a lot. I have talked about my 3 month evaluation period and consider this a time to re-evaluation decisions I have made. This allows my learning to be flexible and adjustable based on what I am focusing on and where the 'pull' is in my life.

Well this happened for me with Node in this 3 month period. I never 'hated' Node, but I just did not understand the 'why'. Everyone says it is "great for a chat app", and as this is not a product I am yearning to do, I just didn't get it.

I saw so many companies using Node and finally just decided I needed to try it. 

## Hello, Server

I did what seems to be the consistent "Hello, World" in Node; building a server using the built in http module and serving some text to a page. Honestly, this blew me away. That I could so quickly serve up some pages without a framework like Rails or even a gem. It is just 'out of the box'.

The other thing I noticed, was that is less abstraction. This is something that has always frustrated me. I understand the tradeoff with abstraction. However, I tend to prefer to have less absctraction 

### Not a Framework

### Week in Review
I ended up with a lot of household projects over the weekend and did not get as much time on coding as I hoped. That said, I did get in a couple exercism exercises through out the week. Many of the problems were ones that I had done in Ruby before and I am now doing in javascript. It was good to see how my problem solving has improved since then and how I working through the problems in a different language that does not offer some of the same niceties as Ruby.

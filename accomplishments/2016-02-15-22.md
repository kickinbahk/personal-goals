### Week in Review

This week was highly productive. Presenting on ES2015 gave me a reason to really dive into some of the new features and tools. Additionally, going through the Node course at the same time is allowing me to begin using some of the features I was learning about. I also had some extra time and was able to do a quick tutorial in React. This is the first time I have done a project with it, so it provided a nice intro. I plan on continuing my focus on Node for the time being.

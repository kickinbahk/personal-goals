### Week in Review

I have really liked working with node so far. In this next week, I will be looking at using express and seeing what the framework provide. I am also presenting on the Es2015 features this week. It should go well, but I am still working on that presentation. It is also the first presentation with `reveal.js`. I have really enjoyed it so far and am looking forward to working with it in the future.

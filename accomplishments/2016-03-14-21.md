### Week in Review
It was nice to finish the Todo API. Additionally, the websockets presentation went really well, which is always nice when you put time into something. I thought I would have the design for the podcast logo, but the designer fell through, so I have another one and will be waiting to get it. I did not get to a blog post this week with all the things I am doing. I am considering moving to a less frequent posting schedule with the addition of the podcast.

### Week in Review
I am still getting used to what life is like married and what I am able to get done in the mornings pre work and the couple evenings that I am able to spend working. I did get a lot done this week and will need to in the upcoming week also as I have my presentation. I am glad to get out the 3rd episode of the podcast and see the response.

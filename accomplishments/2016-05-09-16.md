### Week in Review
I have been mostly focused on getting my new business site ready and out. I am almost finished with it. I am just finalizing the last little details this week. I FINALLY finished that section of Headfirst Javascript. I need to finish this book soon. The simplicity of it makes it difficult to want to spend much time on it.

### Week in Review
I am getting married in a week, so the time is in short supply. I didn't get all I wanted to done and I expect that I will not next week as well. However, I still will make a list and plan on working toward the goals I set. This is the beauty of tracking for me...I can work toward the goals I have set. It took me some time to debug, but the issue I was having getting the pitchers in my new app caused me to look into and learn more about promises. I do prefer promises to callbacks and and continuing to work through the nuances.

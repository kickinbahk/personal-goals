### Week in Review
With getting married this weekend, there was not a lot I was able to get to. There have been many loose ends to wrap up and 

I have not been able to really focus on work. We had to cancel the podcast recording due to the air show nearby and my schedule. Our buffer will take care of it, but we will need to record the third episode soon. I also had a look at helping out express with some of their docs.
